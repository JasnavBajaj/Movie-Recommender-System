# Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python. It leverages movie metadata (including genres, keywords, cast, and crew) from the [TMDB Movie Metadata dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) on Kaggle, and provides movie recommendations based on textual similarity. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for data processing and model building (`movie-recommend.ipynb`) and a Streamlit web app (`app.py`) for an interactive user interface.
